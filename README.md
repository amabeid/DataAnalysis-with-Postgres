Data Analytics of Kaggle E-commerce Dataset

What I have done:
As partial requirement for completion of a 60-hr training course –  “Introduction to Python and Big Data Analysis,” I have analyzed
an e-commerce data set obtained from Kaggle. I asked some questions and tried to find the answers for those questions. To that 
extent, I identified some problems and opportunities by exploring the data set.

Tools that I have used:
In part-I, I used PostgreSQL to extract insights. Then, I graphically represented them using Excel in part-II. The file contains
the postgres codes and insights (part-I).

Description of the data set
The dataset contains records of actual transactions of a registered non-store online retail company based in the UK from 2010 
to 2011. Main products of the company are all-occasion gift items, and many customers are wholesalers. The data set has been 
made available and maintained by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data
